# Metal Drive Kit

Metal Drive Kit is a conglomeration of drive technologies which assist in the development and maintenance of codebases for FIRST Tech Challenge robots. Metal Drive Kit is developed by Thales Academy FIRST Tech Team 11424.

## Metal
The Metal Drive project from the 2017/2018 season, now hosted in its own repository.
The Metal Drive project is a next-generation robot controller designed to make programming for new robots faster and simpler, and extends the feature set of previous control methods. Metal can act as a stand-alone OpMode and controller, or can just be used as a library to make other OpModes simpler and more manageable. This is now mostly deprecated for its lack of flexibility.

## MultiDrive
Another project is the MultiDriveKit, which focuses more on being compatible with multiple drivetrains.
The MultiDriveKit incorporates some of the functions of MetalDriveKit, more focused on being compatible with multiple drivetrains. Similar to Metal, it can be used as a library or a regular opmode.

Has now been replaced with a more efficient program, Anvil.


## Anvil
Anvil is the official derivative of Metal intended to handle multiple drive trains. It is the latest addition to the collection and the most actively developed. Currently, new technologies appear in Anvil before they appear anywhere else. Anvil is constantly undergoing changes to improve it and make it compliant with the latest TAB standards.

## Clasp Teleop
Clasp is a teleop developed for Anvil for use by the Thales Academy FTC Team 11424. 

I was at least right. Tsk, tsk, Gabe.
