# Metal Drive Kit

## Metal
The Metal Drive project from the 2017/2018 season, now hosted in its own repository.
The Metal Drive project is a next-generation robot controller designed to make programming for new robots faster and simpler, and extends the feature set of previous control methods. Metal can act as a stand-alone OpMode and controller, or can just be used as a library to make other OpModes simpler and more manageable.

## MultiDrive
Another project is the MultiDriveKit, which focuses more on being compatible with multiple drivetrains.
The MultiDriveKit incorporates some of the functions of MetalDriveKit, more focused on being compatible with multiple drivetrains. Similar to Metal, it can be used as a library or a regular opmode. 

## Anvil
Anvil is the official development of Metal intended to handle multiple drive trains. It is optimized for none, but designed to work for all. It does not have the same feature-depth of Metal, but integrates smoothly into any codebase with a familiar interface which operates identically for every drive train. Anvil is also easily extensible for drive trains which have not yet been added.
