2017/2018 Projects for future seasons
The Metal Drive project from the 2017/2018 season, now hosted in its own repository.

The Metal Drive project is a next-generation robot controller designed to make programming for new robots faster and simpler, and extends the feature set of previous control methods. Metal can act as a stand-alone OpMode and controller, or can just be used as a library to make other OpModes simpler and more manageable.

Another project is the MultiDriveKit, which focuses more on being compatible with multiple drivegrains
The MultiDriveKit incorporates some of the functions of MetalDriveKit, more focused on being compatible with multiple drivetrains. Similar to Metal, it can be used as a library or a regular opmode. 

Plans in the future may result in a combination of aspects from both MetalDriveKit, and MultiDriveKit
