# Metal Drive Kit

Metal Drive Kit is a conglomeration of drive technologies which assist in the development and maintenance of codebases for FIRST Tech Challenge robots. Metal Drive Kit is developed by Thales Academy FIRST Tech Team 11424.

## Metal
The Metal Drive project from the 2017/2018 season, now hosted in its own repository.
The Metal Drive project is a next-generation robot controller designed to make programming for new robots faster and simpler, and extends the feature set of previous control methods. Metal can act as a stand-alone OpMode and controller, or can just be used as a library to make other OpModes simpler and more manageable.
It is important to know that new technologies tend to appear first in Metal for technological reasons. Most are adapted for other drive systems after.

## MultiDrive
Another project is the MultiDriveKit, which focuses more on being compatible with multiple drivetrains.
The MultiDriveKit incorporates some of the functions of MetalDriveKit, more focused on being compatible with multiple drivetrains. Similar to Metal, it can be used as a library or a regular opmode.

MultiDrive is not guaranteed to work or even run, and is known to have several problems. Use at your own risk.

## Anvil
Anvil is the official derivative of Metal intended to handle multiple drive trains. It is optimized for none, but designed to work for all. It does not have the same feature-depth of Metal, but integrates smoothly into any codebase with a familiar interface which operates identically for every drive train. Anvil is also easily extensible for drive trains which have not yet been added.

## Clasp Teleop
Clasp is a teleop developed for Anvil for use by the Thales Academy FTC Team 11424.
