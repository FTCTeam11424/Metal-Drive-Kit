# Metal-Drive-Kit
The Metal Drive project from the 2017/2018 season, now hosted in its own repository.

The Metal Drive project is a next-generation robot controller designed to make programming for new robots faster and simpler, and extends the feature set of previous control methods. Metal can act as a stand-alone OpMode and controller, or can just be used as a library to make other OpModes simpler and more manageable.
